## Velocity Metrics

### Completed Tickets

- **T01**: 5 points in 0.5 hours = **10 points/hour**
- **T03**: 5 points in 0.18 hours = **27.3 points/hour**
- **T02**: 8 points (time not tracked, but completed)

### Project Totals

- **Total Points**: 37
- **Completed Points**: 18
- **Remaining Points**: 19
- **Completion Rate**: 48.6%

### Performance Insights

- **Current Velocity**: 18.7 points/hour (average of tracked tickets)
- **Peak Velocity**: 27.3 points/hour (T03)
- **Estimated Completion**: If velocity maintains, remaining 19 points would take ~1 hour
- **Realistic Estimate**: Given varying complexity and your proven speed, estimate 2-3 hours for remaining work
- **Recommendation**: Your velocity is exceptional! Consider if estimates for remaining tickets are too conservative.

## Notes

- **T01**: Completed much faster than estimated due to:

  - Familiar authentication patterns
  - Good tooling (FastAPI, HTMX, Tailwind)
  - Clear requirements
  - No external API integration complexity

- **T03**: Outstanding performance due to:

  - Building on solid T02 foundation
  - Clear mathematical requirements
  - Efficient implementation approach
  - Strong understanding of the codebase

- **T02**: Completed but time not tracked. Based on complexity and your pattern, likely completed efficiently.

- **Future Estimates**: Your actual velocity (18.7+ points/hour) suggests you can complete remaining tickets much faster than original estimates. Consider reducing time estimates by 60-70% for similar complexity tickets.
