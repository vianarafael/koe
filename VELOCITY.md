## Quick Reference

- **T01**: âœ… Implement simple email/password authentication system (5 pts) - COMPLETED in 30 minutes
- **T02**: ðŸ”„ Implement CSV import for X Analytics data (8 pts) - IN PROGRESS
- **T03**: ðŸ“‹ Calculate engagement scores based on configurable point values (5 pts) - PLANNED
- **T04**: ðŸ“‹ Build dashboard UI to display tweets sorted by engagement score (8 pts) - PLANNED
- **T05**: ðŸ“‹ Implement user settings to update point values (5 pts) - PLANNED

## Velocity Metrics

### Completed Tickets

- **T01**: 5 points in 0.5 hours = **10 points/hour**

### Project Totals

- **Total Points**: 37
- **Completed Points**: 5
- **Remaining Points**: 32
- **Completion Rate**: 13.5%

### Performance Insights

- **Current Velocity**: 10 points/hour (based on T01)
- **Estimated Completion**: If velocity maintains, remaining 32 points would take ~3.2 hours
- **Realistic Estimate**: Given varying complexity, estimate 6-8 hours for remaining work
- **Recommendation**: T01 was completed very efficiently. Consider if estimates for remaining tickets are too conservative.

## Notes

- T01 was completed much faster than estimated due to:
  - Familiar authentication patterns
  - Good tooling (FastAPI, HTMX, Tailwind)
  - Clear requirements
  - No external API integration complexity
- Future estimates should consider your actual velocity and familiarity with the tech stack
